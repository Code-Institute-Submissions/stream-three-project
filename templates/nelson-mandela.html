                    <p class="painting-description">Nelson Mandela inspired not only his home country of South Africa, but the entire world.
                        He was an icon of love, peace, forgiveness, and change.  Because of this, his death
                        stunned the world and cast a shadow that can only be erased by following his teachings.
                        I began this portrait on the day of his funeral, the 15th of December 2014.  It represents
                        my own respect for this incredible man, as well as the respect of the rest of the world.
                        And, to pay tribute, ten percent of the sales from the original and prints will go the
                        Nelson Mandela Childrenâ€™s Hospital.<br>
